# ganim
This is the repository for ganim, a math animation library based on geometric
algebra.  As you might have guessed from the name, it is sort of based on manim,
but there are notable differences.

This library is very incomplete at the time of writing, so I'm not really going
to be providing any help for people who want to use it, so the readme is pretty
short for now.  In fact, there's actually a hardcoded path on my system
somewhere in here so it really is not intended for general use at the current
moment.  I'll eventually make it much easier to use for the general public, but
for now it's pretty much just my own library.  I've only ever compiled it on my
machine (Arch Linux) so there's probably lots of cmake configuration that needs
to change on other machines.  Documentation can be generated with doxygen.
