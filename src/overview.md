@mainpage Ganim API Reference

This is the API documentation for Ganim.  There are two main libraries
present here: @ref src/ganim "ganim", and `ganim_editor`.  `ganim` contains the
rendering code, while `ganim_editor` contains the graphical editor and plugin
API.  However at the moment there is absolutely nothing in `ganim_editor`
because I haven't made it yet.  For information on these libraries, click the
above links.
