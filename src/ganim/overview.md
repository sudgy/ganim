@dir src/ganim

Currently, Ganim has the following pieces:

- @ref src/ganim/ga "ga", which contains files related to pure
  geometric algebra.
- @ref src/ganim/scene "scene", which contains files related to scenes, which
  are the main class you use for making animations.
- @ref src/ganim/object "object", which contains files related to objects, which
  are the things that appear on screen in a scene.
- @ref src/ganim/animation "animation", which contains animations for objects.
- @ref src/ganim/gl "gl", which contains files for working with
  OpenGL.
- @ref src/ganim/video_writer/video_writer.hpp "video_writer", which contains
  the file that streams images into a video file.

There is also the @ref src/ganim/shaders "shaders" folder that contains shaders
used by objects.
